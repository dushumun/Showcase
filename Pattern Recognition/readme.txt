GUI developed as part of MSc project to showcase the potential for Convolutional Neural Networks
to be implemented in the detection of railway maintenance issues.

Makes use of an ensemble of the VGG-16 and InceptionV3 CNN architectures, with weight parametres gained from transfer learning based on their IMAGENET weights

Python3 and the following libraries must be installed in order to run GUI
-Tensorflow
-Keras
-Numpy

---Installation instructions---

-Extract each file from repository into the same directory
-Download both H5 files from following link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OLgORVFOlRCZ45GgK-_AOcKwRIl-9Oxo
-Place both H5 files in the same directory as other program files.

run SHUMENSEMBLENET 1.34 ResNet.py
